# KerrEikonal2pm
this is the public data for the paper "Systematic integral evaluation in spin-resummed binary dynamics" The mathematica program is dependent on [KiHA](https://github.com/AmplitudeGravity/kinematicHopfAlgebra) 

## Closed form of eikonal
The closed form of the eikonal in stored in "EikonalClosedformList". Sum over it will generate the complete eikonal phase at 2PM of aligned spin with $a\cdot b\neq 0$.

## Spin expansion of the eikonal

## Numerical check of the master integral $\widehat{\mathcal{I}}_3$

## Numerical evaluation of the eikonal at finte spin
